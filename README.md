# Service Data Exploration

In this project, the main purpose was to explore the customer service data and find answers to some interesting questions from the data.

Tha analysis notebook can be viewed <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/animish16/Service-Data-Exploration/blob/master/Service_data_analysis_assignment.html" target="_blank">here</a> (<a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/animish16/Service-Data-Exploration/blob/master/Service_data_analysis_assignment.html" target="_blank">https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/animish16/Service-Data-Exploration/blob/master/Service_data_analysis_assignment.html</a>) in HTML form, or the original Jupyter notebook can be seen <a href="https://github.com/animish16/Service-Data-Exploration/blob/master/Service_data_analysis_assignment.ipynb" target="_blank">here</a> (<a href="https://github.com/animish16/Service-Data-Exploration/blob/master/Service_data_analysis_assignment.ipynb" target="_blank">https://github.com/animish16/Service-Data-Exploration/blob/master/Service_data_analysis_assignment.ipynb</a>).

Some key highlights of this notebook are the methods I created for easy data understanding, graph plotting, and hypothesis testing (t-test and chi-squared). These methods are in In [7], In [8], In [26], In [27], In [28], In [29], In [30], In [31], In [32], In [33], In [34], In [35]. With these methods, visualizing different distributions and testing the statistical difference in various distributions is very easy for the end consumer.
